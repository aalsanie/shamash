<p>
    Reports controllers that expose more than one public endpoint method.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps detect controllers that mix multiple responsibilities or routes
    within a single class, which often leads to bloated APIs and unclear boundaries.
</p>

<p>
    Controllers are expected to act as thin entry points.
    When multiple public methods are present, behavior should be split into
    dedicated controllers or delegated to services and workflows.
</p>

<p>
    See https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/inspections.html#descriptions for more information.
</p>

<p>
    Example of a violation:
</p>

<pre><code>
// Controller exposing multiple endpoints
public class OrderController {

    public void create() {}
    public void update() {}
}
</code></pre>

<!-- tooltip end -->

<p>
    This inspection enforces explicit routing and promotes focused, intention-revealing controllers.
