<p>
    Reports class names that violate explicit and meaningful naming conventions.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps detect generic, abbreviated, or misleading class names that obscure
    intent and weaken architectural clarity.
</p>

<p>
    Banned suffixes such as <code>Manager</code>, <code>Helper</code>, and <code>Impl</code> are flagged,
    as they often hide responsibility instead of expressing it.
    Shortened or abbreviated class names are also reported to encourage self-descriptive design.
</p>

<p>
    See https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/inspections.html#descriptions for more information.
</p>

<p>
    Example of violations:
</p>

<pre><code>
// Generic and banned suffix
public class UserManager {
}

// Abbreviated and unclear
public class AuthSvc {
}
</code></pre>

<!-- tooltip end -->

<p>
    Clear naming establishes architectural intent and reduces the need for additional documentation.
    This inspection promotes domain-driven and intention-revealing class names.
