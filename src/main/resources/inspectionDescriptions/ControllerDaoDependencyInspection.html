<p>
    Reports when a controller directly depends on a DAO class.
</p>

<p>
    Controllers act as entry points to the application and should delegate all
    business and persistence concerns to services. A direct dependency on a DAO
    couples the controller layer to the persistence layer and violates layered
    architecture principles.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps enforce architectural boundaries by ensuring that
    controllers depend only on services or higher-level abstractions.
</p>

<pre><code>
// Forbidden: Controller depends directly on DAO
package io.example.controller;

import io.example.dao.UserDao;

public class UserController {
    private final UserDao userDao;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
// Allowed: Controller depends on Service
package io.example.controller;

import io.example.service.UserService;

public class UserController {
    private final UserService userService;
}
</code></pre>

<!-- tooltip end -->

<p>
    This rule is part of Shamash architectural enforcement and supports maintainable
    layer separation in large codebases.
