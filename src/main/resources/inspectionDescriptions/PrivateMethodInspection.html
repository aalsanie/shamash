<p>
    Reports private methods declared in restricted architectural layers.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection detects private methods inside Controller, Service, and DAO
    layers. These layers are expected to expose explicit behavior and orchestration,
    while implementation details should be moved to dedicated utility or workflow
    classes.
</p>

<p>
    Disallowing private methods in these layers improves readability, testability,
    and architectural transparency by making responsibilities explicit.
</p>

<pre><code>
// Forbidden in controllers
private void validateInput() { }

// Allowed in utility classes
private static void normalize() { }
</code></pre>

<p>
    This inspection enforces clean architecture and domain-driven design practices.
