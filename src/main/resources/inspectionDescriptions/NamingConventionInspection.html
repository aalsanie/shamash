<p>
    Reports class names that violate defined naming conventions.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection detects class names that use banned suffixes such as
    <code>Manager</code>, <code>Helper</code>, or <code>Impl</code>, as well as abbreviated
    class names that reduce clarity and expressiveness. Such names obscure intent,
    leak implementation details, or introduce unnecessary ambiguity.
</p>

<p>
    The inspection helps enforce clean code and domain-driven naming practices by
    encouraging explicit, descriptive class names that clearly communicate purpose
    and responsibility.
</p>

<pre><code>
// Forbidden: banned suffix
public class UserManager {
}

// Forbidden: abbreviated name
public class Utl {
}

// Allowed: explicit and descriptive
public class UserAccountService {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This rule is part of Shamash naming enforcement and is intended to keep codebases
    consistent, readable, and aligned with clean architecture principles.
