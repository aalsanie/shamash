<p>
    Reports architectural violations where a service directly depends on a controller.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps detect improper layer coupling that breaks the intended direction
    of dependencies in a layered architecture, where services should remain independent of
    presentation concerns.
</p>

<p>
    Such dependencies often indicate misplaced logic, hidden control flow, or an erosion
    of service boundaries that makes the system harder to test and evolve.
</p>

<p>
    See https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/inspections.html#descriptions for more information.
</p>

<p>
    Example of a violation:
</p>

<pre><code>
// Service depending on a controller (invalid)
public class OrderService {
    private final OrderController controller;
}
</code></pre>

<!-- tooltip end -->

<p>
    This inspection enforces a strict dependency direction: Controller → Service → DAO.
