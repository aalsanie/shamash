<p>
    Reports classes and methods that appear to be unused and have no incoming references.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps detect dead code that is not referenced anywhere in the project,
    excluding known entry points such as framework-managed components or application entry methods.
</p>

<p>
    Unused classes and methods increase cognitive load, obscure the true structure of the system,
    and often remain after incomplete refactoring or abandoned features.
</p>

<p>
    See https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/inspections.html#descriptions for more information.
</p>

<p>
    Example of a violation:
</p>

<pre><code>
// Unused class
public class LegacyCalculator {

    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This inspection supports safe cleanup by highlighting code that can be removed or reviewed,
    helping keep the codebase minimal, intentional, and maintainable.
