    Reports service classes that depend on controller layers.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection detects dependencies from Service classes to Controller
    classes. Controllers are delivery mechanisms and must not be referenced by
    application or domain services.
</p>

<p>
    Enforcing this rule preserves proper dependency direction and prevents
    infrastructure concerns from leaking into core business logic.

<pre><code>
// Forbidden
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private OrderController controller;
}

// Allowed
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private OrderRepository repository;
}
</code></pre>

    This inspection enforces clean architecture dependency boundaries.
