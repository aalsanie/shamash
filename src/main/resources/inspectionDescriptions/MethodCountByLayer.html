<p>
    Reports classes that exceed the allowed number of methods for their architectural layer.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps detect classes whose size and responsibility have grown beyond
    what is appropriate for their role, such as controllers, services, or utility classes.
</p>

<p>
    Different layers have different complexity budgets.
    Exceeding these limits often indicates mixed responsibilities, missing abstractions,
    or logic that should be extracted into dedicated workflows or components.
</p>

<p>
    See https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/inspections.html#descriptions for more information.
</p>

<p>
    Example of a violation:
</p>

<pre><code>
// Controller exceeding its method limit
public class OrderController {

    public void create() {}
    public void update() {}
    public void delete() {}
    public void list() {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This inspection enforces bounded complexity per layer and promotes
    single-responsibility and compositional design.
