<p>
    Reports private methods declared in architectural layers where encapsulation is discouraged.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps detect hidden logic in controllers, services, and data access layers,
    where behavior should remain explicit and externally visible to preserve clarity and
    maintainability.
</p>

<p>
    Private methods in these layers often indicate responsibilities that should be extracted
    into dedicated utility or workflow classes.
</p>

<p>
    See https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/inspections.html#descriptions for more information.
</p>

<p>
    Example of a violation:
</p>

<pre><code>
// Private method inside a service (discouraged)
public class OrderService {

    private void recalculateTotals() {
        // hidden behavior
    }
}
</code></pre>

<!-- tooltip end -->

<p>
    This inspection enforces explicit behavior at architectural boundaries and promotes
    single-responsibility design.
