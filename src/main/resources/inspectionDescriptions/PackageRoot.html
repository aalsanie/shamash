    Reports classes that are declared outside the configured architectural root package.
</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps detect source files that live outside the expected package hierarchy,
    which can indicate accidental misplacement, architectural drift, or incomplete refactoring.
</p>

<p>
    Keeping all production code under a single, well-defined root package improves discoverability,
    enables consistent layering rules, and prevents unstructured growth.
</p>

<p>
    See https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/inspections.html#descriptions for more information.
</p>

<p>
    Example of a violation:
</p>

<pre><code>
// Class declared outside the architectural root
package com.example.misc;

public class RandomUtility {
}
</code></pre>

<!-- tooltip end -->

<p>
    The root package is intended to represent the logical boundary of the system and may be
    customized to match the project’s architecture.
